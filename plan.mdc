Expanded MDC Plan for Shinmen (Updated with Enhanced Open WebUI-Inspired Chat Playground)
Leveraging the researched details from the Open WebUI codebase, I've further refined the MDC plan. Open WebUI is a self-hosted AI platform with a Python backend (using FastAPI for APIs, pip/Docker/K8s for deployment) and a responsive PWA frontend supporting Markdown/LaTeX rendering. Its chat playground emphasizes user-friendly conversational interfaces with features like response streaming, message history, multi-conversation management, RAG (via #document commands for document integration), web search injection (via #search or #url for browsing), function calling tools (BYOF for custom Python functions), hands-free voice/video input, image generation proxies, and customizable AI interactions. The architecture uses environment variables for configurations (e.g., OLLAMA_BASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY) and supports OpenAI-compatible APIs for flexibility. Ollama integrations (e.g., local model pulling, building, and bundled Docker tags) have been explicitly excluded, as they tie to offline inference management. Similarly, the Pipelines Plugin Framework (for custom workflows like function chaining, rate limiting, monitoring, translation, and filtering—comparable to n8n for automation) has been removed to avoid workflow complexities. Instead, the chat system pivots to fully user-configurable custom APIs (base URL, API key, model name), stored securely via JWT in Redis for per-user/session customization, enabling proxies to providers like Grok, OpenAI, or others without native model hosting.
This update integrates these logics iteratively into Shinmen's Next.js/Node.js/JWT/Redis stack: e.g., chat UI with streaming via Node.js proxies, RAG using Redis for temporary embeddings/storage, function calling as simple API tools (without pipeline chaining), and voice via Web Speech API. UI/UX draws from Open WebUI's clean, responsive design (e.g., chat bubbles, sidebar for convos). Infra accounts for high-concurrency streaming (e.g., Redis pub/sub). Developer workflows include patterns like API proxying for custom configs. Timeline remains 9-13 months; budget +15% for advanced chat features (e.g., RAG processing).
Core Principles for the MDC Plan (Updated)

Iterative Delivery: MDCs prioritize chat increments, e.g., core streaming before RAG, ensuring each adds value like Open WebUI's modular features.
Feedback Integration: A/B test chat elements (e.g., #command UX); use tools like Hotjar for interaction heatmaps.
Tech Stack Refinements: Next.js for PWA-like chat UI (with Markdown via marked, LaTeX via MathJax); Node.js for API proxying (custom base URL calls); JWT for securing configs; Redis for history, sessions, pub/sub, and lightweight RAG storage. Add libraries sparingly (e.g., for voice/Web Speech).
Risk Mitigation: Validate custom base URLs to prevent security issues (e.g., SSRF); test for chat interruptions like stream failures.
Sustainability: Adopt modular structure (e.g., separate chat components for reusability); 85% test coverage, including edge cases from Open WebUI issues (e.g., connection hiccups adapted to custom APIs).

Phase 1: MVP (v1) - Core Validation with Minimal Changes
Focus: Basic chat playground mirroring Open WebUI's essential conversational logics, configured via custom APIs. Exclude any model management or workflows. Break into 9-11 MDCs (1-2 weeks each).

### 🔧 Core Features Implementation

#### 1. Advanced Chat Playground (Open WebUI Style)

**Features Adapted from Open WebUI:**
- True asynchronous chat with multitasking support
- Chat completion notifications for non-active tabs
- Multiple model selection using + button
- System prompts and advanced parameters at multiple levels

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Chat Streaming with Custom API Providers
class ChatService {
  async streamChat(
    messages: ChatMessage[],
    model: string,
    provider: APIProvider,
    parameters: ChatParameters
  ): Promise<ReadableStream> {
    const apiClient = this.getProviderClient(provider);
    
    return apiClient.createChatCompletion({
      model: model,
      messages: messages.map(msg => ({
        role: msg.role,
        content: msg.content
      })),
      stream: true,
      ...parameters
    });
  }

  private getProviderClient(provider: APIProvider): APIClient {
    switch (provider.type) {
      case 'openai':
        return new OpenAIClient(provider.baseUrl, provider.apiKey);
      case 'anthropic':
        return new AnthropicClient(provider.baseUrl, provider.apiKey);
      case 'custom':
        return new CustomAPIClient(provider.baseUrl, provider.apiKey);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported provider type: ${provider.type}`);
    }
  }
}
```

**Chat Interface Components:**
```tsx
// Main Chat Interface (Open WebUI Inspired)
const ChatInterface: React.FC = () => {
  const [selectedModels, setSelectedModels] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [chatSessions, setChatSessions] = useState<ChatSession[]>([]);
  const { streamMessage, isStreaming } = useChat();

  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900">
      {/* Sidebar - Chat History */}
      <ChatSidebar 
        sessions={chatSessions}
        onSessionSelect={handleSessionSelect}
        onNewChat={handleNewChat}
      />
      
      {/* Main Chat Area */}
      <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col">
        {/* Model Selector */}
        <ModelSelector
          selectedModels={selectedModels}
          onModelChange={setSelectedModels}
          providers={providers}
        />
        
        {/* Messages Area */}
        <MessageContainer messages={currentMessages} />
        
        {/* Input Area */}
        <ChatInput
          onSendMessage={handleSendMessage}
          isStreaming={isStreaming}
          multiModelMode={selectedModels.length > 1}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. Custom API Provider System (Replacing Ollama)

**Provider Management:**
```typescript
// API Provider Configuration
interface APIProviderConfig {
  name: string;
  baseUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  modelEndpoint: string;
  chatEndpoint: string;
  authType: 'bearer' | 'api-key' | 'custom';
  requestFormat: 'openai' | 'anthropic' | 'custom';
}

class ProviderManager {
  private providers = new Map<string, APIProviderConfig>();

  async addProvider(config: APIProviderConfig): Promise<string> {
    // Validate API connection
    await this.testConnection(config);
    
    // Fetch available models
    const models = await this.fetchModels(config);
    
    // Store configuration
    const providerId = generateId();
    this.providers.set(providerId, config);
    
    return providerId;
  }

  async testConnection(config: APIProviderConfig): Promise<boolean> {
    // Test API endpoint connectivity
    // Validate authentication
    // Return connection status
  }

  async fetchModels(config: APIProviderConfig): Promise<ModelInfo[]> {
    // Query API for available models
    // Parse model information
    // Return standardized model list
  }
}
```

#### 3. Function System (Open WebUI Inspired)

**Function Types Adapted:**
```typescript
// Function Plugin System (Open WebUI Style)
interface Function {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'pipe' | 'filter' | 'action';
  code: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  global: boolean;
  models?: string[]; // Specific models this applies to
}

// Pipe Function - Custom Model/Agent
interface PipeFunction extends Function {
  type: 'pipe';
  model_name: string; // How it appears in model selector
  execute: (input: string) => Promise<string>;
}

// Filter Function - Input/Output Processing
interface FilterFunction extends Function {
  type: 'filter';
  inlet?: (input: string) => Promise<string>; // Process input
  outlet?: (output: string) => Promise<string>; // Process output
}

// Action Function - Chat Message Buttons
interface ActionFunction extends Function {
  type: 'action';
  button_label: string;
  icon?: string;
  execute: (message: ChatMessage) => Promise<void>;
}
```

**Function Execution Engine:**
```typescript
class FunctionEngine {
  private functions = new Map<string, Function>();

  async executePipe(functionId: string, input: string): Promise<string> {
    const func = this.functions.get(functionId) as PipeFunction;
    if (!func || func.type !== 'pipe') {
      throw new Error('Invalid pipe function');
    }
    
    return await func.execute(input);
  }

  async applyFilters(
    input: string, 
    output: string, 
    modelId: string
  ): Promise<{ input: string; output: string }> {
    const filters = Array.from(this.functions.values())
      .filter(f => f.type === 'filter' && (f.global || f.models?.includes(modelId)))
      .map(f => f as FilterFunction);

    let processedInput = input;
    let processedOutput = output;

    for (const filter of filters) {
      if (filter.inlet) {
        processedInput = await filter.inlet(processedInput);
      }
      if (filter.outlet) {
        processedOutput = await filter.outlet(processedOutput);
      }
    }

    return { input: processedInput, output: processedOutput };
  }
}
```

#### 4. RAG Integration (Document Processing)

**Document Management System:**
```typescript
// RAG System (Open WebUI Inspired)
interface Document {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'pdf' | 'docx' | 'txt' | 'md' | 'url';
  content: string;
  chunks: DocumentChunk[];
  embeddings: number[][];
  metadata: DocumentMetadata;
  uploadedAt: Date;
}

interface DocumentChunk {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  embedding: number[];
  startIndex: number;
  endIndex: number;
  relevanceScore?: number;
}

class RAGService {
  async processDocument(file: File): Promise<Document> {
    // Extract text content
    const content = await this.extractText(file);
    
    // Split into chunks
    const chunks = await this.chunkDocument(content);
    
    // Generate embeddings
    const embeddings = await this.generateEmbeddings(chunks);
    
    return {
      id: generateId(),
      name: file.name,
      type: this.getFileType(file),
      content,
      chunks: chunks.map((chunk, index) => ({
        id: generateId(),
        content: chunk,
        embedding: embeddings[index],
        startIndex: 0, // Calculate actual positions
        endIndex: chunk.length
      })),
      embeddings,
      metadata: await this.extractMetadata(file),
      uploadedAt: new Date()
    };
  }

  async searchDocuments(
    query: string, 
    documents: string[], 
    threshold: number = 0.7
  ): Promise<DocumentChunk[]> {
    const queryEmbedding = await this.generateEmbedding(query);
    
    // Vector similarity search
    const results = await this.vectorSearch(queryEmbedding, documents, threshold);
    
    // Re-rank with cross-encoder
    return await this.rerankResults(query, results);
  }
}
```

You said:
for playground we need this https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui.git 
ChatGPT said:

Got it ⚡ — you want a Playground inside Shinmen, and for that you’ve picked Open-WebUI
 as the base. That’s a strong choice: Open-WebUI is modular, supports multiple LLM backends, and already has a chat + playground-like UI.

Here’s how we can integrate it into Shinmen’s vision (MVP → scalable → enterprise):

🧪 Shinmen Playground Plan (based on Open-WebUI)
1. MVP Integration

Embed Open-WebUI inside Shinmen’s Next.js app via iFrame or direct integration.

Connect Open-WebUI backend to Shinmen’s API key service (so only authenticated users can access).

Redis used for session persistence and short-term chat memory.

PostgreSQL stores persistent conversations.

Playground limited to one AI provider (e.g., OpenAI or Ollama local LLM).

👉 Deliverable: A working chat playground accessible from Shinmen dashboard.

2. Scalable Version (v2)

Deep integration:

Replace Open-WebUI’s auth with Shinmen JWT auth.

Use Shinmen’s API key manager to control access.

Support multiple backends: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, local models.

Add multi-agent playground mode (select agents, compare responses).

Redis for real-time collaboration (two users can join same playground).

Persistent IDE + Playground link (write code, test prompts in same workspace).

👉 Deliverable: Fully integrated Playground that feels native to Shinmen.

3. Enterprise Version (v3+)

Multi-tenant support → different teams/clients run isolated playgrounds.

Custom LLM deployment → enterprise clients can plug in their own hosted models.

Audit logs → track all playground usage for compliance.

Role-based access → some users can create/play, others can only view.

Marketplace integration → use Shinmen marketplace agents directly in Playground.

👉 Deliverable: Enterprise-grade Playground for secure AI collaboration.

4. Infra Considerations

Run Open-WebUI backend as a microservice alongside Shinmen’s Node.js API.

Use Redis Pub/Sub for chat streaming + live updates.

Deploy on Docker/Kubernetes for modular scaling.

Reverse-proxy Open-WebUI endpoints through Shinmen API Gateway for unified access.

5. UI/UX Adjustments

Theme Playground to match Shinmen’s dark/futuristic design (glassmorphism, gradients).

Add quick toggle:

Playground Mode (for experiments).

Production Mode (integrated APIs + analytics).

Code snippet copy/paste → one-click export from Playground to Web IDE.

✅ With this setup, Shinmen’s Playground is not just a chat demo — it becomes a bridge between experimenting with AI prompts, coding in the IDE, and deploying via Shinmen APIs.

Do you want me to write a step-by-step integration guide (how to fork Open-WebUI, embed into Next.js, connect JWT/Redis/Postgres, and unify the UI), or should I keep it high-level in the product doc style?

ChatGPT said:

Sure — here’s the updated MDC integrating Open-WebUI as the foundation for the chat/playground modules, removing Ollama and n8n, and replacing them with custom API endpoints (URL + API key + model name).

1. Audit of Open-WebUI Codebase

Open WebUI
GitHub

n8n — I didn’t see direct mention in code, but if it's present as a feature or plugin, strip it out.

Clean up unused RBAC utilities if not required.

Simplify backend pipeline to focus on chat and playground scenarios.

Opportunities for adaptation:

Replace model provider abstraction layer to support custom API base URL, API key, and model name configuration.

Expose pipelines or plugin hooks to integrate with Shinmen's auth, usage tracking, and API key management.

Embed RAG support, document uploading, etc., as advanced future functionality.

2. MDC Revision: Playground / Chat Integration
A) MVP Phase (v1)

Feature set:

Chat Playground based on refactored Open-WebUI frontend and backend.

Model configuration UI allows users to specify:

Custom API base URL,

API key,

and Model name (via secure settings).

Authentication integration: wrap the Open-WebUI service behind Shinmen’s JWT auth and route through the API Gateway.

Context management: store recent chat context in Redis, persist history in PostgreSQL (for history browsing).

Basic RAG/document support could be deferred to a minimal “upload file” fallback if high ROI.

Remove Ollama-specific UI, configuration, and backend components.

Provide theming to align UI with Shinmen (dark mode, token counts, usage display).

Rate limiting: pipeline hook to enforce API key usage and usage stats.

Infra:

Deploy Open-WebUI as a microservice container or internal Node/Python service.

Integrate with the API Gateway for routing, auth enforcement, and rate limiting.

Why this improves MDC:

Delivers a rich chat/playground experience in MVP quickly.

Users can experiment with different LLM endpoints without complex setup.

Allows usage tracking, auth, and branding alignment.

B) Scalable Version (v2)

Enhancements:

Multi-agent / multi-model sessions: present a UI to switch between model endpoints, or run multiple in parallel for output comparison.

Session/project workspace: tie chat sessions into a workspace, save as persistent projects.

IDE ↔ Playground integration: allow users to send code snippets from the Web IDE into the playground to execute or query.

Incorporate document-based RAG pipelines: allow upload of knowledge documents and retrieval-augmented chatting.

Add analytics panel: per-session token usage, model latency, cost estimation.

Plugin architecture: pipeline before/after request to allow custom logic (like usage tracking, moderation, or function calling).

Security/UX:

Enforce RBAC (team roles/owners can view all chats, others limited).

Provide API endpoint validation and whitelisting.

Improve UI/UX: conversations browsing, search, export.

C) Enterprise Edition (v3+)

Advanced requirements:

Deployment options: allow on-premise or VPC deployment of the playground service for enterprise clients.

Custom LLM hosting: support company-specific LLM servers or private endpoints (along with certs, TLS).

Audit logging for all requests and usage (for compliance).

SLA and scaling: autoscaling support via Kubernetes, horizontal scaling of backend and pipelines.

Optionally expose the plugin/pipeline API to enterprise developers to build custom transformations or integrate with internal APIs.

Additional UI support: report generation, filtering of sessions, admin dashboards for monitoring usage across teams.

3. Updated MDC Blueprint (Playground + Chat)
Updated Feature Evolution Table:
Feature	MVP (v1)	v2 (Scalable)	v3 (Enterprise)
Chat/Playground UI	Based on Open-WebUI	Multi-agent, sessions, integration w/ IDE	Enterprise hosting, audit logs
Model Config	Custom API URL + key + model	Multiple endpoints, comparison UI	Private endpoints + security
Auth & Access	JWT + API Gateway routing	RBAC, team ownership	Enterprise SSO, logs
Usage Tracking & Analytics	Basic rate-limiting, usage stats	Session metrics, cost estimation	Full reporting, dashboards
RAG / Documents	Minimal or optional	Full document-upload + retrieval	Enterprise-grade RAG and storage
Infra	Container/microservice	Scaled service + pipeline	K8s, high availability, autoscale
4. Next Steps

If you’d like, I can:

Map out the module boundaries between Shinmen’s Node.js API Gateway and the refactored Open-WebUI backend.

Create sequence flows for chat request handling (auth → rate-limit → API forwarding → response → usage storage).

Or scaffold the refactoring plan, including which Open-WebUI components to prune, and where to inject pipeline hooks for tracking, theming, and custom API routing.

Let me know which direction you’d like next!
